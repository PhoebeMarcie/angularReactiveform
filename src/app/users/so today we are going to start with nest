so today we are going to start with nested formgroup and form array in angular 10
im going to create new module users & create a form for user info this format 

{
    name: null,
    lname: null,
    address: {
        address 1: null,
        address 2: null,
        state: null,
        country: null
    },
    contacts: [
        {
            phoneNo: null,
            email: null
        },
        {
            phoneNo: null,
            email: null
        }
    ]
}
so let create the html and design first.
